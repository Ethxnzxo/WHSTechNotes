Precision affects the outcome of a program because if you are not precise with your actions in code, something can go terribly wrong. This is because when you are not precise you are bound to make more mistakes.
The things that can happen if steps or details are missed in coding is stuff can go wrong. I know this because you need to do every step for things to go right. This evidence is correct because in coding, you need to make sure every step is right or things can go unexpected and stuff can crash. 
It is important to develop good habits of attention early on because if you dont, you can forgot lots of stuff and you can break things. I know this because one time I forgot to pay attentionwhen we doing stuff with the bolt and the thing did not go as expected. This evidence proves that if you dont pay attention in class ot work stuff can go horribly wrong.
